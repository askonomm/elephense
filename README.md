<!--
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip!Â As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions â†’ Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "Intelephense" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Include a brief description of the features your extension provides. For example:
-->

**Intelephense** provides LSP support for PHP via [Intelephense](https://intelephense.com/).

Intelephense is developed by [Ben Mewburn](https://github.com/bmewburn) on [GitHub](https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense/), and is not involved in the development of this extension. I've made this extension available since it's useful for myself, and hope it will be useful for others.

**This extension is very much in an alpha stage**, has incomplete support, and has several known issuesâ€”one of which makes the Extension Runtime in Nova unstable.

ðŸŽˆ It can also be helpful to include a screenshot or GIF showing your extension in action:

## Requirements

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension depends on external processes or tools that users will need to have, it's helpful to list those and provide links to their installers:
-->

Intelephense requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

<!--
âœ¨ Providing tips, tricks, or other guides for installing or configuring external dependencies can go a long way toward helping your users have a good setup experience:
-->

> If you want to use a different version of Intelephense than the bundled version you can set a path to the executable in the extension preferences.

## Usage

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension provides features that are invoked manually, consider describing those options for users:
-->

To run Intelephense:

-   Just activate the extension.

Once the extension is activated it will attempt to install Intelephense in the extension workspace, if no installation is found.

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Alternatively, if your extension runs automatically (as in the case of a validator), consider showing users what they can expect to see:
-->

### Configuration

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension offers global- or workspace-scoped preferences, consider pointing users toward those settings. For example:
-->

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select Intelephense's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project â†’ Project Settings...**

<!--
ðŸ‘‹ That's it! Happy developing!
